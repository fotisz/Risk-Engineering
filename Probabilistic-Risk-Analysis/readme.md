# Risk modelling and quantification 
## The probabilistic approach to safety

Overview

Rather than using point values to represent random quantities, as in deterministic approaches, probabilistic approaches to risk assessment represent each random quantity by a probability distribution. Analysis results are presented as probability distributions, or as selected quantiles of a probability distribution.

The probabilistic approach to risk analysis estimates risk as a function of:
